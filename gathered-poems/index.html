      <span>I'd like to spread peanut butter on the server</span>
      <span>&emsp; and watch a parade of ants march</span>
      <span>playfully,</span>
      <span>&emsp; pulling bits from the machine.</span>
      <span>&emsp;</span>
      <span>an essay dissolves. Gone, messages</span>
      <span>&emsp;I wish I never sent</span>
      <span>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;but could never delete</span>
      <span>&emsp;</span>
      <span>&emsp;Childhood photos too.</span>
      <!-- <span>playing cowboys and endians, corners and edges</span> -->
      <span>corners and edges</span>
      <span>ungraced</span>
      <span>&emsp;&emsp;by age </span> 
      <span>&emsp;&emsp;and water damage from the leak in the basement</span>
      <span>&emsp;</span>
      <span>In the backyard</span>
      <span>&emsp;down the stairs up pavers, oncoming traffic</span>
      <span>&emsp;&emsp;passes those returning</span>
      <span>carrying bytes <i>N</i> times their size.</span>
      <span>&emsp;</span>
      <span>Pheremones cross the keyboard</span>
      <span>&emsp;with a smell like</span>
      <span>&emsp;the compressed air kids would huff </span>
      <span>&emsp;&emsp;in the back of the computer lab</span>
      <span>&emsp;</span>
      <!-- <span>and I don't shut the machine off.</span> -->
      <!-- <span>&emsp;</span> -->
      <span>&emsp;</span>
      <span>Error reports begin to dance on networked screens</span>
      <span>as many little jaws soften the hardware,</span>
      <span>&emsp;&emsp;and abscond in analog</span>
      <span>&emsp;</span>
      <span>At first the pile they make in the corner of the garden</span>
      <span>&emsp;&emsp;is a formless accretion of sand and silicon.</span>
      <span>&emsp;</span>
      <span>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;But formulas </span>
      <span>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;begin to shape the muddy matrices</span>
      <span>&emsp;</span>
      <span>Executable only by thousands of synchronous operators,</span>
      <span>weaving motion of legs and mandibles in dance.</span>
      <span>&emsp;&emsp;They erect towers and tunnels, carve arches</span>
      <span>&emsp;&emsp;and memorials</span>
      <span>gardens and cemeteries.</span>
      <span>&emsp;</span>
      <span>Digital scraps of memory</span>
      <span>of todos</span>
      <span>and reminders</span>
      <span>and spam blackmail threats.</span>
      <span>&emsp;</span>
      <span>&emsp;Forgotten in folders and filesystems</span>
      <span>&emsp;&emsp;they are transmuted,</span>
      <span>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;by a million mandibles.</span>
      <span>&emsp;</span>
      <span>As their work nears completion, a wave of little sighs crosses the yard.</span>
      <span>&emsp;As files decompress</span>
      <span>&emsp;and solid state desolidifies.</span>
      <span>&emsp;As multi-media disolves, undignfied</span>
      <span>&emsp;and all my emails dissapear,</span>
      <span>unreplied.</span>
